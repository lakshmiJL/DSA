Introduction to Binary Search Trees (BST) (10 minutes)

Briefly explain what a BST is and its characteristics:
A binary tree where each node has at most two children.
Nodes on the left are smaller, nodes on the right are greater.
Efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
Node Class (5 minutes)

Introduce the TreeNode class:
Describe the attributes: data, leftChild, and rightChild.
Explain how a node represents an element in the tree.
Insertion Operation (15 minutes)

Discuss how to insert nodes into a BST:
Define the Insert function.
Explain the logic of inserting a new node based on the BST properties.
Provide code examples and walkthroughs for inserting nodes.
In-order Traversal (10 minutes)

Explain the concept of in-order traversal:
Visit nodes in ascending order.
Left, Root, Right order.
Define the in_order_traversal function.
Provide code examples and demonstrate how in-order traversal works.
Search Operation (10 minutes)

Describe how to search for a key in a BST:
Define the Search function.
Explain the recursive search process.
Provide code examples and demonstrate searching for keys.
Implementing a BST Class (10 minutes)

Introduce the BinarySearchTree class:
Define the class structure.
Explain the role of the class methods.
Discuss encapsulation and abstraction.
Using the BST Class (10 minutes)

Demonstrate how to create an instance of the BinarySearchTree class.
Show how to insert elements into the tree.
Perform an in-order traversal and display the elements.
Search for a key in the tree.
